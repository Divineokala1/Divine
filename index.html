        <h3>
          REASON WHY I CAME TO ALT SCHOOL AFRICA
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph2">
          I came to all school because after discovering what skill i wanted to
          develop in me, which is to become a software developer, i realized i
          couldn't just do it all by myself and decided then to join a school of
          engineering that could build my Tech career.Getting to hear of alt school
          in the year 2022, i did my research and asked a passed student from alt
          school africa that works presently for union bank in their cybersecurity
          department and alt was the best recommendation she gave me and i decided
          to build my Tech career in alt school africa.
